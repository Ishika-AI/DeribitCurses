This is a keyboard driven interface for Deribit
It's still a bit rough around the edges and missing alot of functionality.
What's working at the moment is buying, selling and cancellation of all orders.

standard input is:
buy 					: a
sell					: s
move buySell away from index price 	: k
move buySell towards index price 	: j
cancel all orders 			: c

this can be can be changed in settings.py
